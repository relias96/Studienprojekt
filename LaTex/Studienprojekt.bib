	abstract = {In the 1970s ecological research detected chaos and other forms of complex dynamics in simple population dynamics models, initiating a new research tradition in ecology. However, the investigations of complex population dynamics have mainly concentrated on single populations and not on higher dimensional ecological systems. Here we report a detailed study of the complicated dynamics occurring in a basic discrete-time model of host–parasitoid interaction. The complexities include (a) non-unique dynamics, meaning that several attractors coexist, (b) basins of attraction (defined as the set of the initial conditions leading to a certain type of an attractor) with fractal properties (pattern of self-similarity and fractal basin boundaries), (c) intermittency, (d) supertransients, (e) chaotic attractors, and (f) “transient chaos”. Because of these complexities minor changes in parameter or initial values may strikingly change the dynamic behavior of the system. All the phenomena presented in this paper should be kept in mind when examining and interpreting the dynamics of ecological systems.},

	abstract = {We present a fully automated method that identifies attractors and their basins of attraction without approximations of the dynamics. The method works by defining a finite state machine on top of the dynamical system flow. The input to the method is a dynamical system evolution rule and a grid that partitions the state space. No prior knowledge of the number, location, or nature of the attractors is required. The method works for arbitrarily high-dimensional dynamical systems, both discrete and continuous. It also works for stroboscopic maps, Poincaré maps, and projections of high-dimensional dynamics to a lower-dimensional space. The method is accompanied by a performant open-source implementation in the DynamicalSystems.jl library. The performance of the method outclasses the naïve approach of evolving initial conditions until convergence to an attractor, even when excluding the task of first identifying the attractors from the comparison. We showcase the power of our implementation on several scenarios, including interlaced chaotic attractors, high-dimensional state spaces, fractal basin boundaries, and interlaced attracting periodic orbits, among others. The output of our method can be straightforwardly used to calculate concepts, such as basin stability and final state sensitivity.},

Parasitoids are amongst the most abundant of all animals, and make up about 10\% or more of metazoan species. Almost no insect species escape their attack. Host-parasitoid interactions were first modelled over fifty years ago, but for many years there was little good empirical information on the important factors that affect host and parasitoid populations. The models were very simple, and their predictions rather divorced from the complexity of what was visible in the field. Now, better data is available on many components of host-parasitoid systems, from field observations and laboratory and field experiments, and this allows a much closer correspondence between models and data. In particular, the past twenty years have seen major advances in our understanding of how host-parasitoid interactions are influenced by spatial processes, by age-structure effects, and by competition from additional host and parasitoid species. The result is a body of theory that makes direct contact with real systems in the field, and provides us with a detailed understanding of what underpins a whole area of population dynamics. In this book, Michael P Hassell pulls the theory and field data together to present an elegant illustration of the way in which ecological studies advance.

	abstract = {This paper reviews the biology of insect parasitoids and cleptoparasitoids and places them in an evolutionary context. Available biological data are reviewed and tabulated (at the family level) with an emphasis on non-hymenopteran parasitoids. Existing cladistic or near-cladistic treatments of the parasitoid groups are used to make outgroup comparisons, and pathways to and from the parasitoid lifeway are estimated. Approximately 10\% of all described insect species are parasitoids or cleptoparasitoids. Of these about three-quarters are Hymenoptera, and one-quarter are either Diptera or Coleoptera. The parasitoid lifeway has arisen most commonly in the Diptera, where it has evolved independently in 21 families (probably over 100 times). It has arisen in 11 coleopteran families but probably only once in the Hymenoptera. In most cases host searching is by the adult female parasitoid but in a significant minority of cases host-searching is by the first instar larva of the parasitoid, or (more rarely) by the host ingesting the parasitoid’s egg. Dipteran parasitoids (as a whole) have a wider host range than hymenopteran or coleopteran parasitoids. The most common pathways to parasitoidism are from mycophagy, saprophagy and predation. In contrast, evolutionary shifts away from parasitoidism are relatively rare. Possible evolutionary explanations for these pathways are reviewed and others are suggested. A possible (evolutionary) explanation of the common evolutionary association of parasitoids with specialized egg predators is also discussed.},
